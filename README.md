# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
Use the following machine learning models to predict credit card risk analysis:
- Oversampling
  - Naive Random Oversampling
  - SMOTE Oversampling
- Undersampling
- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

 **Data used : LoanStats_2019Q1.csv**


## Purpose: 
The purpose of the study is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. I Used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, then I oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
