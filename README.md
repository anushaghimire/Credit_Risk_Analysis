# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
## Purpose: 
The purpose of the study is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.



## Results:  
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
